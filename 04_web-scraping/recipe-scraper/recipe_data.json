Add one ladle of stock at a time and stir. Adjust the heat so it\u2019s barely boiling. Just a couple bubbles here and there.\nOnce the liquid is absorbed, add another ladle of stock, stir, and repeat. Watch, smell, and taste. From adding the first ladle to the last, it takes about 25 minutes from start to finish. Taste, but be careful with adding salt too soon. The stock will add additional salt, and so will the salty Parmigiano Reggiano.\u00a0\nWhen the rice is done, add (at least) 1 Tbsp butter and (at least) 1/2 c of Parmigiano Reggiano (the good stuff). Stir for about 2 minutes and add a couple cranks of black pepper (1/4 tsp).\n\nMushroom Risotto\n\nHeat 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.\u00a0\nAdd 1/4 c chopped shallots and cook for 2 minutes until translucent.\nAdd 8 oz sliced mushrooms, 1 Tbsp minced garlic, 1 tsp dry thyme and/or sage, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper. Stir occasionally and cook (simmer) for about 8 minutes.\u00a0\nOnce the mushrooms have absorbed all the liquids, taste them and add more salt if necessary. Remove from the saucepan and set aside.\u00a0\nNext, cook the risotto as outlined in the Basic Risotto recipe above.\nOnce the risotto is ready in its creamy deliciousness, put the cooked mushrooms back in the risotto and stir it all together.\nSprinkle with some roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley and pour yourself a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

Enjoy!!!\n\n", "Excited to share a dish I grew up with! \nThe salmon is a super easy weeknight recipe that\u2019s ready in under 25 minutes, and the sauce is something my parents always have a stash of in their fridge, since it pairs well with a ton of different dishes.\nHere's the video for a walkthrough.\nSourcing Salmon Sustainably\nFor this specific recipe, my parents bought Atlantic salmon. With regards to Atlantic vs Pacific, farmed or wild-caught, there\u2019s no right or wrong choice, but my parents have a slight preference for Atlantic salmon, which nowadays are primarily farmed.\u00a0\nAs one of the world\u2019s most consumed species of fish, salmon is a massive industry, with several million tons sold every single year, and tons of complexity surrounding how we source it in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way.\u00a0\nAs consumers, an easy way to do our part is by making sure we vote with our wallets. Monterey Bay Aquarium in California runs a free website and mobile app called \"Seafood Watch\" which has a ton of recommendations on how to choose and purchase seafood in ways that have the least environmental impact.\nSalmon + Chinese communities in the west\nAs I was researching this recipe, I felt like it was important to share how salmon and fishing helped form some of the first Chinese communities in the West.\nDuring the Gold Rush, tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Guangzhou, flocked to California enticed by the promise of the G\u0101m S\u0101an, or gold mountain in Cantonese, although many were forced out of mining work due to discrimination.\u00a0\nUndeterred, a group of experienced fishermen found their own gold in abalone and other fish along the Monterey coast. Known as China Point by locals, Chinese immigrants proudly sparked the first large scale commercial fishing industry in California, supplying fish and shellfish to countries all over the world.\u00a0\nDuring and after the Gold Rush and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, many Chinese immigrants relocated to Seattle, Vancouver, and surrounding areas to work for salmon canneries and on fishing boats, doing the difficult work of supplying and processing most of the world\u2019s salmon at the time.\nToday, the once thriving Chinese enclave in Monterey no longer exists, but in spite of periods of intense discrimination and oppression, Seattle and Vancouver are still homes to some of the largest Chinese communities abroad.\nTHE RECIPE\nOverview\n\nPrep Time: 10 min\nTotal Time: 25 min\nYield: 4 servings\n\nIngredients for Salmon\n\n1.5 lb salmon\n1 egg\nwhite pepper (to taste)\n3 tbsp cornstarch\n2 tbsp corn oil\n0.50 tbsp rice cooking wine\ngarlic salt (to taste)\n\nDipping Sauce\n\n1 tbsp sugar\n0.50 tbsp vinegar\n2 tbsp light soy sauce\n0.25 tsp chili sauce (to taste)\n2 tbsp boiling water (very important)\n\nOptional Garnish\n\ncilantro\nbroccoli\n\nStep 1 - Cut salmon\nThis is totally optional, but if you're planning on garnishing the salmon with anything (like cilantro) or serving it with any vegetables (like broccoli), then it's best to cut it before the salmon (for sanitation).\nTo make our salmon (1.5 lb) fillets, make diagonal cuts about 2 cm apart. The diagonal cuts help increase the surface area of the fillets, which leads to a faster cook and less moisture loss.\nStep 2 - Coat salmon\nSpread the fillets out on the cutting board, and sprinkle white pepper on each side. The white pepper helps counter some of the \"fishy\" taste of the salmon, which has a slightly negative connotation in Chinese cuisine.\nWe'll crack and mix our egg(s) (1) into a bowl, and spread out cornstarch (3 tbsp) on a plate.\nCoat each side of each salmon fillet first in the egg, and then the cornstarch. Make sure each side is evenly coated.\nThis coating helps the salmon retain its juices, and also add some delicious crunchy/crispiness when it's cooked.\nStep 3 - Cook salmon\nHeating the wok\nWe\u2019ll set our stove to medium high and let our wok heat up.\nUnlike other Chinese recipes, with salmon, it\u2019s important that the wok gets hot enough but not too hot. It\u2019s difficult to give an exact amount of time, since it depends a lot on your stove and cookware.\nMy dad relies on his own intuition that he\u2019s developed over 50 years of cooking. For the rest of us, he waited about 2-3 minutes on this current setup.\nCook the salmonThen, we\u2019ll add corn oil (2 tbsp), and swirl it around the wok.\nThe wok and the oil should be hot enough once the oil starts shimmering, or making ripples.\nOnce this happens, we\u2019ll add our salmon to the wok.\nMy dad had just enough room for 8 fillets, so try not to overcrowd your wok and consider cooking in multiple batches if necessary.\nThe total cooking time for the salmon also varies depending on how hot your stove is, how thick each fillet is, and what type of pan or wok you\u2019re using.\nOn my dad\u2019s current setup, which has less heat output than a gas stove, he cooked each fillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, generally not flipping the salmon over more than once.\nFor a visual cue, once the salmon fillet starts to turn more white / yellow-ish, you can flip it.\nYou should be able to tell if the salmon is done if it easily flakes. If you wanted to get more precise, you can also insert an instant-read food thermometer into the thickest part of the salmon.\nOther tips\nAs long as it\u2019s cooked enough, the rest is just a lot of trial and error to find the texture of salmon that\u2019s perfect for you. My dad tends to prefer salmon that\u2019s more medium or well-done, so if you prefer something more rare, then adjust accordingly.\nKenji from the Food Lab has a great blog post and video with a bunch of helpful tips on how to pan fry salmon. Not all of these tips apply to this specific recipe, but it\u2019s still a great resource, and I\u2019ve linked to it in our description.\nStep 4 - Add flavors, cover wok\nAdd garlic salt to the fillets.\nThen, we'll add rice cooking wine (0.50 tbsp). We should have the lid for the wok within reach, because we\u2019ll be covering the wok immediately after we pour the cooking wine in. We\u2019ll only be covering the wok for about 20 to 30 seconds before we take the lid off.\nStep 5 - Uncover, plate, garnish\nUncover the wok, and turn the heat off. Transfer the salmon fillets to a plate, and add any garnish you'd like.\nStep 6 - Create sauce\nTo make the sauce, mix together sugar (1 tbsp), vinegar (0.50 tbsp), light soy sauce (2 tbsp), boiling water (2 tbsp), and chili sauce (0.25 tsp). Mix it all together for about 5-10 seconds.Notes:\n\nIf you prefer more spiciness, feel free to add more chili sauce.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why my dad specifically uses boiling water, it\u2019s to help extend the shelf life of the sauce. My parents elaborate on why during our \"Meal Time\".\n\n-------\nOur why\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\nThanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipe :)\n", "Shortbread Crust:\n100g or 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter, soft.\n50g or 1/2 cup Sugar\n150g or 1 cup + 2 tbsp All Purpose/Plain Flour\nCaramel Filling:\n200g or 2/3 cup Condensed Milk\n150g or 2/3 cup Unsalted Butter\n50g or 1/2 cup Sugar\n50g or 3 tbsp Golden Syrup, can also use Honey or Maple Syrup\nChocolate Topping:\n200g or 1 cup Chocolate Chips/Squares\nPrep:\n\nPreheat oven to 350F/175C. Line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper and grease the sides with butter.\nIn a bowl, beat sugar and butter to form a smooth paste. Add flour and gently mix it all together. Use your hands to knead and mop up all the crumbs.\nFlatten crust inside pan and try to level it as much as you can. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until your crust is a light golden brown around the edges. Let it cool in the pan.\nWhile your crust is baking, start the caramel. Put all filling ingredients into a saucepan and place on medium-high heat, stirring gently. Watch it closely as you stir. If you see little brown slivers at the bottom of the pan, stir them in vigorously and turn the heat down to a low-medium. Simmer it gently until it reaches a deep, golden brown color. It should take around 15 minutes.  \nWhen ready, pour the caramel over the cooled biscuit crust and spread evenly using an offset spatula or knife. Let this cool for at least an hour. You don\u2019t want the caramel to be warm or it\u2019ll ruin your chocolate. Don\u2019t cool in the fridge or else you\u2019ll end up with a hard mess. \nMelt chocolate using microwave or double boiler and pour over cooled caramel to finish off.\nTo serve, heat up a knife using hot water (make sure you dry it) or a blowtorch. This will ensure you get a nice clean cut. Cut into whatever size slices you want; I usually go for 1-inch squares.\n\nIf you want to watch the video of it being made, feel free to check it out here:\nhttps://www.thesulkychef.com/home/millionaires-shortbread\n", "They made this cake on the most reason season of the British baking show!

Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion, saut\u00e9 for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to saut\u00e9 till mixture is fragrant. \u00a0\u00a0\nAdd the diced bell pepper, saut\u00e9 for 5-7 minutes over medium until softened.\nAdd tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir until blended. Add spices and sugar, stir, and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes until it starts to reduce.\u00a0\nAt this point, you can taste the mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka (be careful with the cayenne... it is extremely spicy!).\nCrack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook \"over easy\" style on top of the tomato sauce.\nCover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn't reduce too much, which can lead to burning.\nSome people prefer their shakshuka eggs more runny. If this is your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few minutes before cracking the eggs on top-- then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to taste.\u00a0Garnish with the chopped parsley, if desired.\nShakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. For breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce (if you are gluten-intolerant or celebrating Passover, skip the bread). For dinner, serve with a green side salad for a light, easy meal.\n( A good thing to do if pepper give you stomach pain and it works for me everytime it's to roast them in the oven for 25 min then place them in a bowl cover with cling film for 10 min !

I used the recipe from this site for the focaccia.\n>Ingredients\n>1/2 cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil\n>2 garlic cloves, finely minced [I used 5, but my husband and I are garlic fiends]\n>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried\n>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried\n>1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper\n>1 cup (235 ml) warm water\n>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)\n>1/4 teaspoon honey\n>2 1/2 cups (315 grams) all-purpose flour\n>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\nDirections\nIn a cold medium skillet, combine olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, and the black pepper. Place the pan over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes or until aromatic, but before the garlic browns. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and honey. Stir a few times then let sit for 5 minutes.\nAdd 1 cup of the flour and a 1/4 cup of the infused garlic-olive oil mixture to the bowl with yeast and honey. Stir 3 to 4 times until the flour has moistened. Let sit for another 5 minutes.\nStir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. When the dough comes together, transfer to a floured board and knead 10 to 15 times until smooth.\nTransfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, cover with a warm, damp towel and let rise for 1 hour. (It\u2019s best to let the dough rise in a warmer area of your kitchen).\nAfter 1 hour, heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\nUse two tablespoons of the remaining garlic-olive oil mixture to oil a 9-inch by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. (See above if you do not have this pan size).\nTransfer the dough to the baking sheet then press it down into the pan. Use your fingers to dimple the dough then drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the garlic-olive oil mixture. Let the dough rise for 20 minutes until it puffs slightly.\nThis is where I slightly deviated from the website's recipe.\nI added sliced bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, kalamata olives, black olives, green olives, cauliflower, and sprigs of thyme, rosemary, dill, and chives for the springtime decor. Just pressed slightly down into the dough. Then back to the original recipe.\nBake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool baked focaccia bread on a wire rack. [I ended up lowering the heat to 350 after 15 min and continued baking for another 6-ish minutes. It was slightly hard to the touch at this point instead of springy and I was worried I had overcooked it, but once it cooled and we cut into it, it was PERFECT.]\n", "Of course kids love this. I'm an adult but I also can finish a bucket of this ;)\nSo crunchy yet juicy, and the kimchi mayo helps bringing this dish to another level of deliciousness! \nINGREDIENTS:\nA. For chicken & marinate:\n\n500g of boneless, skin on chicken meat (thigh/breast)\n3 smashed cloves of garlic\n1 egg white\n1tbs Korean soy sauce\n1.5 tbs sesame oil\n\u00bd tsp white pepper powder\n1 tbs corn starch\nA sprinkle of salt\n\n\u200b\nB. For Kimchi Mayo: (start with less, taste, then add more if needed)\n\n2 tbs finely chopped kimchi\n2 tbs kimchi juice\n1 tbs sugar\n1tbs Korean hot pepper flakes\nA squeeze of lime juice\n4 tbs mayo\n\n\u200b\nC. For sprinkles:\n\n1 large sheet of nori seaweed\n1 tbs untoasted white sesame seeds\n\n\u200b\nD. For Frying:\n\n7-8 tbs tapioca starch or more if needed\nCanola oil\n\n\u200b\nTIPS:\n- I used chicken thighs with skin on, but you can use chicken tenders or breasts as well.\n- All mayo and kimchi have different level of salt, sugar and acidity. My kimchi was very sour, so I had to add a little more sugar. Because of the differences, make sure to use lesser, so that you can taste and adjust to your own taste bud!\n- Caramelising kimchi helps to tone down the funky smell and takes the raw taste off. Plus, who doesn\u2019t love anything caramelised?\n\u200b\nSTEPS:\nA. Marinating chicken:\n\nCut chicken into bite-sized cubes, then add other ingredients\nMix well and refrigerate for 1 hour\n\nB. Making Kimchi Mayo:\n\nIn a small pan, add 1tbs of oil.\nAdd finely chopped kimchi and fry until caramelized\nAdd sugar and kimchi juice. Reduce and allow the mixture to cool down before mixing other ingredients in.\nIn a bowl, combine all ingredients, then taste and add more sugar/salt/lime if needed. The tanginess and umami of kimchi should come first, with just a little bit of sweetness to balance things up.\n\nC. Making sprinkles:\n\nUse tongs to toast nori seaweed under the lowest flame until crispy\nToast sesame seeds in a small pan until lightly golden\nBlend both into fine powder and set aside\n\nD. Frying:\n\nOn a large tray, add 7 tbs of tapioca starch, add more later if needed.\nDrop chicken cubes and coat well. Make sure they don\u2019t clump together.\nRest for 10 mins\nHeat oil in a wok under medium heat, use chopstick to test the oil. Bubbles = ready.\nDrop chicken pieces into oil. Shake off excess starch if necessary\nRemove once the cubes are lightly golden\nSkim the small bits if needed, then bring to medium high heat for 1-2 mins\nDouble fry the chicken for extra crisp\nRemove once golden brown\nImmediately toss the sprinkles together with the chicken in a large bow\nServe immediately.

Meat Sauce\n-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n-  3 large carrots, peeled & finely chopped\n-  1 large onion, diced\n-  4 large cloves garlic, minced\n-  1 green bell pepper, diced\n-  16 ounces lean ground beef\n-  8 ounces ground pork\n-  \u00be cup red wine\n-  2 cans, or fresh (28 ounces) diced tomatoes\n- 1 tablespoon tomato paste \n- 1/2 tablespoon ketchup \n-  Course kosher salt (Diamond Crystal Brand) and fresh, or dried, Italian herbs (oregano, rosemary, thyme).\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nIn a 10 or 12 inch heavy-bottomed stainless steel or cast-iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until sufficiently pre-heated. Add onion and carrots, season slightly with a healthy pinch of kosher salt. Saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 8 minutes.\nAdd garlic and bell pepper. Continue cooking until garlic is fragrant but not scorched.\nIncrease heat to high. Add beef and pork and cook, breaking apart the meat with a wooden spoon until mostly browned. Approximately 10 minutes.\nAdd wine and deglaze. Boil off the wine until it is mostly evaporated, 3-4 minutes at least.\nStir in tomatoes with all liquid if using canned. Reheat to boiling and then reduce heat to medium-low.\nAdd ketchup and tomato paste \nSeason with more salt and select italian herbs to your liking. \nSimmer the now mostly completed sauce, uncovered, for at least 20 minutes or until the sauce has thickened sufficiently.\nPreheat oven to 375.\n\nB. B\u00e9chamel\n-  Metal whisk\n-  2 tablespoons butter\n-  3 tablespoons flour\n-  2 cups of milk, heated to just under a boil\n-  Salt and white pepper\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nIn a 2 or 3 quart saucepan, melt butter over low heat.\nOnce butter is completely melted and covering the bottom of your saucepan, blend in the flour by small amounts, stirring frequently with whisk.\nOnce all flour is blended in, continue cooking for 2 minutes without browning or coloring the mixture.\nRemove from heat. Allow to slightly cool and then pour in the heated milk in one swift motion. Immediately and quickly blend the mixture together with whisk.\nReturn saucepan to the stove over medium-high heat and continue stirring quickly until the sauce comes to boil.\nBoil for about 1 minute, while stirring, until sauce is thick enough to coat and cling to the back of a spoon.\nRemove from heat and season slightly with kosher salt and white pepper. Careful not to over-season as to avoid overpowering the dish.\nIf sauce is too thin, boil it down while stirring continually until reduced and thickened. If sauce is too thick, simmer and thin out with milk added in a tablespoon at a time. If sauce is lumpy, either strain or blend it and then simmer for a few minutes.\n\nC.

Best method is to use a tablespoon, dropping dollops across the layer and then spreading slightly. The filling will loosen while cooking so it does not have to be perfect.\nRepeat steps 2-4 with all remaining ingredients until you finish with a final layer of meat sauce.\nTop assembled lasagna with filling and freshly grated parmesan.\nCover with foil and bake 30 minutes in preheated oven at 375.\nRemove foil and bake for 15 additional minutes.\nRemove dish from the oven and raise oven rack to the highest position. Set broiler to high and place uncovered lasagna on topmost rack directly under heat elements. Broil carefully, with over door ajar, until the top is perfectly crisped and brown.\nTurn off heat, remove from oven and rest for a minimum of 15 minutes.\nWith a serrated knife, divide lasagna into equal portions and guide your cuts by the small gaps between noodles.\nServe garnished with fresh chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese.

Funny name but really delicious.\n", "I thought it would be cool to make a very traditional Ragu alla Bolognese; i.e. the sauce that was the catalyst for the famed 'Spaghetti Bolognese' dish a lot of us know and love. This dish is said to have originated in Italy's Bologna region hence the name. For anyone interested it was Pelligrino Artusi who first published ragu as a recipe back in 1891.\u00a0  \nThe below recipe is just for the ragu sauce - it will make enough to top 6 servings of pasta. Best pasta to serve this with is tagliatelle, fettucine, or pappardelle.\u00a0\nPrep Time: 30 minutes\nCook Time: 3+ hours\nTotal Time: Approx 6 hours\nServings: 6\nEQUIPMENT\n\nSaucepan\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\u2022 250g beef, hand minced (chuck, brisket, short rib, shank all work)\u2063\n\u2022 250g pork, hand minced (shoulder is best)\u2063\n\u2022 Extra Virgin Olive Oil\u2063 (EVOO)\n\u2022 1 onion, diced\u2063\n\u2022 1 rib celery, diced\u2063\n\u2022 1 carrot, diced\u2063\n\u2022 2.5 tbs tomato paste (concentrated)\u2063\n\u2022 1 cup red wine\u2063\n\u2022 1 cup stock (chicken or beef) + more for topping up\u00a0\u2063\n\u2022 1 cup whole milk\u2063\n\u2022 1 cinnamon stick\u2063\n\u2022 1 bay leaf\u2063\n\u2022 a largish segment of lemon peel\u2063\n\u2022 A little pinch of nutmeg\u2063\n\u2022 Salt & black pepper to taste\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nUse a sharp knife or a heavy cleaver to finely chop the meat into a course mince.\nHeat a heavy bottomed pot on high-heat add enough EVOO to cover the bottom about 1/4 inch thick then add beef and saute for 6-7 minutes until browned on the outside. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon ensuring you leave rendered fat in the pot and set aside.\nRepeat the above step for the pork.\nAdd onions, carrot, celery and saute for 15 - 20 minutes.\nAdd red wine, then the beef and pork back in, then tomato paste, stock, milk, cinnammon, bay leaf, nutmeg, lemon peel. Give everything a good stir and season with salt (about 1 tbs) and black pepper\nSimmer on low heat for 3-6 hours - taste every half an hour; if it gets dry top up with either water or stock. It's done when the meat is tender and no longer chewy; obviously the longer you cook the more tender/melt in your mouth it will get.\u00a0\n\nTO SERVE\n\nTagliatelle Egg Pasta (cook according to packet instructions and add as much ragu as you like and a dash of reserved pasta water to make it a little saucy) \nGrated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese \nCracked Black pepper \nGlass of Red Wine!\u00a0 \n\nFor those interested, below is a 2 min video of cooking process end to end.\nRagu alla Bolognese Vid\u00a0\n", "i want it inside me\n", "The original recipe\nIngredients:\n\n1 tbsp olive oil\n1 onion\n2 cup chicken broth\n2 tbsp soy sauce\n1 lb fresh chicken breast\n4 oz mushrooms\n2 cup snow peas\n1 tsp fresh ginger\n1 tsp paprika\n1 clove garlic\n2 squares ramen noodles\nfresh cilantro\nsalt\npepper\neggs\nradish\nsesame seeds\nsesame oil\n\nInstructions:\n\nPrep the ingredients: finely chop the garlic and ginger, slice the onion and mushrooms, and trim the snow peas.\nTurn on the saut\u00e9 mode on the Instant Pot.

I hope everyone enjoys it :)\n", "I've never made anything with dough before, here is my version of the recipe I found:\nRecipe: Cinnamon Rolls\nIngredients\nDough\n\n1 cup whole milk warmed (105-140\u00b0)\n2 packages (or 5 teaspoons) active dry yeast\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n5 cups all-purpose flour separated (plus extra for rolling out the dough)\n3 large eggs room temperature\n1/2 cup unsalted butter room temperature, cut into chunks\n2 teaspoons fine sea salt\n\nFilling and Glaze(Egg wash)\n\n1 egg, room temperature, slightly beaten for sealing edge and egg wash on top\n3/4 cup firmly-packed light brown sugar\n2 tablespoon ground cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\n1/3 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, separated\n\nIcing\n\n1 block Cream Cheese\n1 cup Powdered Sugar\n1 tbs unsalted butter\n1/8 tsp vanilla\n\nDirections\n\nGrow the yeast: Add the warmed milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or just in a bowl. The milk should feel very warm to the touch, but not scalding hot. Use a thermometer to gauge exact temperature if desired. Sprinkle over the yeast, and stir to moisten. Allow to stand until foamy, about 5-7 minutes.\nMake the dough: Add sugar, 4 1/2 cups of flour, eggs, butter and salt to the yeast. Place remaining 1/2 cup of flour in a small bowl. Mix on low just until the contents of the stand mixer come together. Do not over mix. Double check to makes sure you have added all of the aforementioned ingredients before moving on to the kneading stage.\nKnead the Dough: I kneaded by hand for 10 minutes, adding in bits of the last of the flour as necessary. Here is from the recipe: Remove the paddle attachment and attach the dough hook. Knead the dough on low speed (e.g. speed 2 if using a KitchenAid\u00ae stand mixer), and continue to so for 5-7 minutes, adding in the reserved flour 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed, to prevent the dough from sticking to the sides of the bowl. Alternatively, knead the dough by hand.\nDough Rise: Have ready a large oiled bowl. Once the dough is properly kneaded, appearing smooth and elastic in texture, transfer to the oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to proof in a warm, draft-free spot until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 - 2 hours.\nFilling:  Have ready a greased 9x13\u201d baking dish, and prepare the egg wash by beating together the egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Set aside until ready to use. To make the filling, in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Set aside until ready to use.\nRoll 'em out: Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut in half with a sharp knife. Set one half aside, and begin working with the other. Lightly dust the dough with flour. Pat out the dough into the shape of a rectangle. Using a rolling pin dusted with flour, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring close to 12 x 14\u201d. Rotate the dough (if necessary) so that one of the short sides is in front of you.\nFill 'em: Spread half of the butter across the surface of the dough, stopping about 1\u201d from the short side opposite of you. Sprinkle with half of the cinnamon sugar mixture, and rub across with the butter, patting to adhere and taking care to leave cleared space at end for egg wash. Brush the clear area lightly with the egg wash. Set aside egg wash and reserve.\nRoll 'em up: Starting on the short side closest to you, begin rolling into a log. Once rolled, pinch together the seam and place seam-side down on your work surface. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut off the tapered ends and discard.\nCut Rolls: Cut the log into 6 equal pieces. Stagger the rolls evenly across half of the greased baking dish. Repeat with the remaining log, and proceed to fill the dish. You should have 12 cinnamon rolls total. I wasn't careful enough with forming, rolling out, or cutting, so I got 16 and cooked the ends also. Unflavored dental floss is best for cutting them, slide a piece underneath and wrap it around up to the top and cross the strings and pull.\nSecond Rise: Cover the rolls loosely with a kitchen towel, and allow them to rise in a warm, draft-free spot until they have doubled in size, about 40 minutes.\nBake: Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Brush the reserved egg mixture across the top of the cinnamon rolls. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Set aside and allow to cool slightly.\nIcing: Whisk room temp icing ingredients until smooth. Pour across rolls and spread.\nInhale\n\n", "The \"cozonac\" is found everywhere in Romania - it's made every time we're celebrating something important, such as Christmas.\nThe ones I made here are filled with a walnut and cocoa paste, flavored with vanilla and rum essence. Other varieties exist, such as the very popular turkish delight cozonac.\nIt's a difficult dough to knead by hand because it requires lots of effort and strong arms. I'd rather not attempt it without a stand mixer but that is up to you. The short story is: you want to knead it until you're able to grab a piece with both hands and stretch it to a semi-transparent film that doesn't break.\nHere is a video version of the recipe, which should help especially when it comes to rolling the cozonac. It's in Romanian but I translated the steps.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa6HlVP5LV0\nIngredients for two small or a single large cozonac:\nFor the dough:\n\n500 to 550 grams of flour (I used \"000\" flour which I think is equivalent to \"pastry flour\")\n250ml milk\n8 egg yolks (size M)\n100g powdered sugar\n25g granulated sugar\n25g fresh yeast (or the equivalent dry yeast, as indicated on the package)\n100g butter\n25ml oil with neutral taste (such as refined sunflower oil - note that unrefined sunflower oil does carry taste and smell)\n1 tbsp rum essence\n1 tbsp vanilla essence\nthe zest of a lemon, a similarly sized orange or a combination of the two\na good pinch of salt\n\nFor the walnut filling:\n\n350g crushed walnuts, I like them very finely crushed but you can leave some chunks in if you want\n100ml milk\n200g granulated sugar\n1 tbsp cocoa powder (I used dark cocoa powder)\n1 tbsp rum essence\n1 tbsp vanilla essence\n2 egg whites (size M)\n\nYou'll need some oil, a yolk or two and some milk for finishing as well.\nSteps (dough):\n\nPlace 50g of the flour in a bowl, and get 100ml of milk boiling. Once boiling, pour it over the flour and mix well. Take 25g of yeast and 25g of granulated sugar and beat them together until you get a liquid. You can do this in the same bowl if you're sure the yeast won't touch the hot flour paste. Wait until the flour paste has cooled down and then combine the two together, spread some flour on top, cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size. This will be our \"scalded starter mix\".\nOnce that's done, place the remaining flour in your stand mixer's bowl, together with the lemon/orange zest. Mix on the lowest speed, just to combine.\nBeat the egg yolks with a good pinch of salt, the oil, the rum and vanilla essences and then mix with 150ml of lukewarm or room temperature milk.\nAdd the liquid mixture obtained above to the stand mixer bowl, together with the scalded starter mix that should've risen by now. Turn on the stand mixer on low at first, and gradually increase the speed to a medium-high, until all ingredients are completely combined.\nKeep mixing, add the powdered sugar, half of it at a time.\nOnce the powdered sugar has been added, continue mixing on a high speed for another 10 minutes.\nYou may need, every now and then, to stop the mixer and scrape the dough from the bowl and the attachment. This dough is very very sticky. At the end we'll cover our table in oil and the thing will most likely still stick to it in some places.\nAfter 10 minutes it's time to add the butter, in small chunks. Don't add the next chunk until the previous is completely incorporated.\nOnce the butter has been completely incorporated, keep mixing at high speed for another 15 minutes. Unless you've chosen to do it by hand, in which case you'll have to give the dough a real good smashing for 45 whole minutes. You're pretty badass if you chose this route, not gonna lie.\nRemember the doneness test: you want to knead it until you're able to grab a piece with both hands and stretch it to a semi-transparent film that doesn't break.\n\nPlace the dough in a bowl that's been greased with oil, cover with a towel, and let to rise until doubled in size in a warm place.\nSteps (filling):\n\nPlace the crushed walnuts in a bowl.\nBring 100ml of milk and 200g granulated sugar to a boil, mixing continuously to dissolve the sugar properly.\nPour the hot milk & sugar mixture onto the walnuts and mix well.\nAdd the cocoa powder, vanilla and rum essences, the two egg whites, and mix again. Some people choose to beat the egg whites first, I added them as they came out of the egg. Works either way.\n\nFinal steps (refer to the video I linked above to best get these steps right):\n\nThe dough should've risen by now. Spread some oil on your working surface, take the dough out of the bowl and spread it into a rectangular shape that's fairly thin. You can do this by hand because the dough is extremely easy to shape.\nIf you want to make two portions, cut the rectangle in two. Once rolled, the dough should fit in your rectangular loaf tins so keep this in mind.\nCover the dough with the walnut filling, leaving out a couple of centimeters around the filling to help with the rolling.\nRoll from top to bottom, constantly bringing the sides of the rectangle towards the inside.\nMake sure you've rolled it well and securely sealed it.\nPlace a baking sheet in your pan, making sure to cover the sides properly, then very carefully place the rolled up cozonac in it. Careful, it's fragile, so get your fingers underneath it from the get-go.\nBeat an egg yolk with a tablespoon or two of milk, and carefully brush the surface of the cozonac.\nLet it sit covered in a warm place for 45 mins or so, or until it increased in size and reached the top of the pan.\nIn the meantime, preheat your oven to 190 degrees celsius.\nGet the cozonac in the oven, and let it bake for about 10 minutes, at which point you want to cover it with aluminium foil and bake for another 40 minutes.\nTake out of the oven, let cool down a bit in the tin, then take them out and let cool further on a rack.\n\nNormally you don't cut into them until they're completely cooled, but rules are made to be broken. I like to eat pieces of the crust while it's still hot.

(SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU WISH.)\nReduce heat to low-medium heat, add the cream and bring to a gentle simmer, while stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.\nAdd in the spinach leaves; allow to wilt in the sauce, then add in the parmesan cheese. Allow sauce to simmer for a further minute until cheese melts through the sauce. (For a thicker sauce, add the milk/cornstarch mixture to the center of the pan, and continue to simmer while quickly stirring the mixture through until the sauce thickens.)\nMix in the herbs and garnish with parsley. \nServe over mashed cauliflower, zucchini noodles or steamed veg. Alternatively, serve over pasta, mashed potatoes or rice.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve made this dish, I think boiling some gnocchi and adding it in at the end would be amazing.

Pipe or spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border bare. Press the charm into the filling. Moisten the border with cold water, position the second circle of dough over the filling and press around the border with your fingertips or the rim of a bowl to seal well.
